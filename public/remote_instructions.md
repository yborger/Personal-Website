While away from computer, this is the best way to convey my ideas for updates and reorganize for return.

Tasks to complete -- CODING
--component: project card display on projects page --> show one image, projectcard:hover for title, on click it's a new page w/ write-up
--portfolio page: display project card component for each project, flex style for easy mobile
--concept art is a project w/ a description of design process
--general artwork is my miscellaneous art --> this can be displayed in the squares and rectangles method i want to organize with
^^-->the description of this idea is in the portfolio or component page for the projects, but it's better when the art can be randomized
	bc the big projects should be organized by
--add folder for each final project from swarthmore for projects portfolio -- I have "icons" for the course, I can use those for representation

Tasks to complete -- NOT CODING
--portfolio write-up descriptions for each phase of design process
--add the final projects from swarthmore with a description of the premise, the write-up from the project since I wrote those, and link to github
