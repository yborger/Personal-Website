Tasks to complete -- CODING
--component: project card display on projects page --> show one image, projectcard:hover for title, on click it's a new page w/ write-up
--portfolio page: display project card component for each project, flex style for easy mobile
--concept art is a project w/ a description of design process
--general artwork is my miscellaneous art --> this can be displayed in the squares and rectangles method i want to organize with (descrip below)
^^-->the description of this idea is in the portfolio or component page for the projects, but it's better when the art can be randomized
	bc the big projects should be organized by
--add folder for each final project from swarthmore for projects portfolio -- I have "icons" for the course, I can use those for representation

Tasks to complete -- NOT CODING
--portfolio write-up descriptions for each phase of design process
--add the final projects from swarthmore with a description of the premise, the write-up from the project since I wrote those, and link to github

General Art PAGE LAYOUT IDEA -- perfect square dissection?
    It is late but I had an idea for the layout (for the future, not now)
    Rather than make the page have to scroll, which I don't love I can make an algorithm that creates X amount of randomly sized squares, with the X amount being the amount of projects I have to show.
    I think I could use the amount of cases I have and the size of the window, maybe I would use standard window sizes (tailwind has css breakpoints sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, and mobile-size is good) to generate patterns of squares to take up the screen space

    To do this I need to design the algorithm that takes dimensions at the breakpoints and quantity of cases.
    This will be a whole design idea.

    -This will incentivize me to increase project amount as well :)
    
    While away from computer, this is the best way to convey my ideas for updates and reorganize for return.
