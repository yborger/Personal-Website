Tasks to complete -- CODING
[     ]--HOME/ABOUT/CONTACT: combine the pages into one scroll-animated page on the home area
[     ]--PORTFOLIO - projects from college: add folder for each final project from swarthmore for projects portfolio -- I have "icons" for the course, I can use those for representation
[     ]--ART: general artwork is my miscellaneous art --> this can be displayed in the squares and rectangles method i want to organize with (descrip below)
    ^^-->the description of this idea is in the portfolio or component page for the projects, but it's better when the art can be randomized
	bc the big projects should be organized by
	^^-->i can make the program that gives a one sentence description of the artwork image? or i can pre-put them hmm
[     ]--PORTFOLIO: finish phasecard stacking with scroll animation
[     ]--PROJECT: new project concept -- the website accessibility checker? considering


Tasks to complete -- NOT CODING
[     ]--WRITE-UPS: portfolio write-up descriptions for each phase of design process -- BY PHASES
[     ]--WRITE-UPS: add the final projects from swarthmore with a description of the premise, the write-up from the project since I wrote those, and link to github
[     ]--WRITE-UPS: resume rework

General Art PAGE LAYOUT IDEA -- perfect square dissection or bento-box style
    
    While away from computer, this is the best way to convey my ideas for updates and reorganize for return.



Plan of Action for Cards:
Guide for tilt of cards: https://codepen.io/manz/pen/YzRQMYW
-uniform sizing of cards? -> definitely needed else it looks *really* bad
-card tilt added --> 2 or 3 deg max otherwise things are problems
-parallax esque, it's currently being implemented
-the stack did not look as nice as i'd hoped when implemented -- the images overlapping did not have the desired effect



Note:
-v3 not v4 for tailwind, not updating to v4 until v4 is actually compatible with my code, or if I change my code to be compatible with the new requirements. At the moment it fully crashes my site.
-receiving reminders whenever i run to check on compatibility issues in incoming updates
