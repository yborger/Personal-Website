    Notes/checklist:

    This is specifically for the "scroll and it will appear" section of the projects
    So these are the cards that fan out/in as you scroll

    -title: at the top, say the PHASE TITLE (design phase, planning, etc.)
    -img: image with image carousel option?
            -can i make the img parameter be like a folder route and have it display all images in the folder in a carousel?
    -descrip: the writing that goes along with this card
            -expect it to be between 2-5 sentences
    
    Animation into global.css, left appear is written so now we need the full card

export default function phaseCard(title, img, descrip){
    return{
